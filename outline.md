At the highest level, the talk implements the following structure:
    1. Introduce the basic concepts of conceptual metaphor theory.
    2. Illuminate, by example, the ways in which developers already (unconsciously) employ conceptual metaphor in their daily work.
    3. Offer examples and suggest exercises developers can use to willfully apply associative analysis and metaphor to their future work.

        "That isn't a *core* module"

    * KNOWLEDGE IS LIGHT (depends on KNOWING IS SEEING)

# Metaphor In Software Development
    * We tend to think exclusively of UI design and iconography
